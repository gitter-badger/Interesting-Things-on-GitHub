### spm 781


![spm](https://i.alipayobjects.com/i/localhost/png/201404/2YQxOTYoFp.png)

This is [the issue](https://github.com/spmjs/spm/issues/781) in the project [spmjs](https://github.com/spmjs). The team wants to popularise a brand new **static package manager** for browser. However, it's a good try and not everyone loves to accept, by agreeing to the spm, you need to introduce a new key **spm** to your **package.json** which doing the exact same job **package.json** is doing.
